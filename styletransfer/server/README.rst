Audio, video and data channel server
====================================

This example illustrates establishing audio, video and a data channel with a
browser. It also performs some image processing on the video frames using
OpenCV.

Running
-------

First install the required packages:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install aiohttp aiortc opencv-python

When you start the example, it will create an HTTP server which you
can connect to from your browser:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python server.py

You can then browse to the following page with your browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8080

Once you click `Start` the browser will send the audio and video from its
webcam to the server.

The server will play a pre-recorded audio clip and send the received video back
to the browser, optionally applying a transform to it.

In parallel to media streams, the browser sends a 'ping' message over the data
channel, and the server replies with 'pong'.

JSON EXAMPLE
.. code-block:: console
    $ {
    $ "image" : "image encoded in base64",
    $ "benchmark" : "float 0-1",
    $ "color" : "boolean"
    $ }

Additional options
------------------

If you want to enable verbose logging, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python server.py -v
